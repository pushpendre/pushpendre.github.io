I am interested in language understanding and reasoning and I hope to
make some contributions to this area during my thesis.
Over the past few months I have come across some exciting papers on
merging syntactic/proof theoretic/resolution based/symbolic reasoning
with vector space semantic based/model theoretic/approximate
reasoning.

The primary reason that this merger is necessary is because completely
syntactic systems have low recall, high precision and hard-to-scale
inference procedures but vector space based systems don't have these
shortcomings.

In this article, I would try to summarize a number of interesting
papers from the "Symposium on KRR" that was held at Stanford during
March 2015 under the aegis of the AAAI. I actually did not know about
the symposium when it happened and only came to know about it when
specific google searches turned up two or three papers that were all
presented at this symposium.

I would organize my overview by the different universities and teams
primarily because the approaches taken are well split according to the
teams and I find it easy to remember the approaches by names of
people.
