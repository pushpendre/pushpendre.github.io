<p>My mom has died because of the coronavirus. I do not know what to do next. I want to fly back to Delhi, but everyone is asking me to think about my newborn and what will happen if I also get infected. I am afraid of the virus. There is no space in hospitals.&nbsp; I have got one dose of Pfizer. I failed my parents. She was with me in Seattle till 24Mar, just one month ago. She came on 26Dec and she made lots of sweaters for her grand-daughter. And we went for long walks together, to the beach, to the zoo, to sunset hill park. She did yoga everyday and I loved how happy she was. I failed my parents because I didn't get them vaccinated in US. I thought it's not a big deal, the Indian vaccine is not inferior to US. My parents got the first dose on 2 April.&nbsp; The Indian vaccine is useless. I thought that there is no need to hurry, we don't know what side-effects the MRNA vaccine has. No need to rush . I was lazy and now I am guilty. I feel like I killed her. I can't fly back to India and now I don't know what to do for the next 4.5hr before my father wakes up and I have to tell him the news. My father is alone now. He spent 16hr on Monday to get mom admitted into a hospital. He struggled from 4am to 8pm and he did it, and then he developed a fever and now he is taking Ivermectin, Azythromycin, and Doxycyclin, and steam.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a phd, my sister is a medical doctor, my Dad was a professor in DU, and with all our brains we were stupid. My mom got sick on 12 April, she had diarrhea, and fever and she said that its just a reaction to the first dose of the vaccine and we believed that. I didn't use my brain, I didn't challenge her enough. I didn't ask her to take this more seriously and I am stupid, my mom is dead and I am guilty. I don't want to die but I wish someone will kill me. We should have force fed her Iver, Azy, Doxy, without worrying about side-effects. We did not take the right decisions, and we were too slow, and we were stupid.</p>

<p>I am angry. I am angry at the lies, the theft, the fake data. We couldn't get her phone back from the hospital. I couldn't be found at the DRDO hospital. She took so many photos with her grand-daughter, which she didn't get a chance to upload. We have lost all of them. I hate people who either stole a dead person's phone or simply misplaced her belongings. Now papa will start the process of getting her death certificate, to shut down her bank account, her insurance, her phone numbers. I hate the future, because I know that the government dept which issues death certificates will have huge delays and they will justify the delays saying that too many people have died. It's not their fault and they can't do anything about it. They can not anticipate the lakhs of death certificates that they will have to make based on the 24 hour news broadcast 7 days a week, and they can't scale their operations. Everyone must wait.</p>

<p>There was a fire at a hospital in Mumbai. 13 people died. There was an oxygen leak at a hospital in Nasik. &gt;10 people died. The sheer incompetence is a nail in my head.&nbsp; But now I do see the pain behind these numbers. These are numbers which are still raw. The doctors and the hospitals and the fingers and the arms of our system. They work. They produce numbers which are trust-worthy. The public health administration is the brain and the brain has chosen to lie. The brain chose alternative facts. The public health admin is lying to people. The health minister released a report claiming less than 4 out of 10K people get infected after their first dose of the vaccine. That's a lie. They are either lying, or they are sloppy. I know of more than 7 people who got infected, from independent families. People who did not meet each other, and did not sample 20K people to find these 7. The positive rate in Delhi is 33%. The majority of people who got vaccinated are in big cities like Delhi.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am in Seattle. The governor here rolled back the restaurant occupancy rate to 25% from 50% because of a small increase in positivity. A simple Proportional-Derivative control. Infection rate goes up, restrictions go up. I never heard of a single warning from the government before the calamity. We were sleeping on the wheel. Just like the captain who ran Titanic full steam into an iceberg, our government has run our country full steam into this disaster.</p>
